### What I learned

This project is one of the most challanging and i had to do some research, ask for help from friend and the internet. Durng these process, my understanding on flexbox, CSS Grid and responsive design was increased. So i can confidently implement any frontend design now. 


### Continued development

While this project has incresed my frontend knowledge, there are a lot concept i still need to learn. These include using CSS Preprocessors and frameworks for better and more responsive designs.
